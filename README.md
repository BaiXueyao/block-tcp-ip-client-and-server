# block-tcp-ip-client-and-server
An simple exmple for tcp/ip client and server.

str_echo() function means the client send message to the server,
the server get and resend this message to the client. 

We can change this method like make it be a chat room. 
It very simple that just change the the standar input and output.

For the client, the second argument is the server's ip address.
Both of them have port number 7899, of course you can change this 
port number, but make sure they must be same.
